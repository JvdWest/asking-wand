# The Asking Wand

The Asking Wand was a project that I created to ask my then-friend (now wife) to be my girlfriend. Essentially, it is a wand equipped with vertical LEDs that are programmed using C. Using a PIC18 microchip, I carefully controlled the switching of the LEDs. By turning them on and off in a specific sequence, I was able to write a special message onto the wand.

To read the message, you simply need to wave the wand left to right. The flashing LEDs are so rapid that the human eye cannot process them individually. Instead, they appear to spell out a message in the air.

It was with this wand that I asked my friend to be my girlfriend. The same person is currently my wife.
